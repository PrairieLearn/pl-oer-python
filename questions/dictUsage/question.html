# Use the Dictionary!
You are working on a database for your company, using Python to organize data into a neat dictionary. You've built this system from scratch, and it's your pride. The dictionary `products` contains information from all the company's products. The key is the **product number**, and the value is another dictionary containing two keys, **name** and **price** , and their corresponding values. Here is an example of one product data:

```
'C200': {'name': 'UIUC Coaster', 'price': 399.99}
```

Now, your boss wants some product information that should be extracted from the dictionary `products`:

-   get all the product numbers, store them in a list, `products_number`. You may find `list()` useful.
-   find the product information for **{{params.prod_info}}**, store it in `product_info`. It should be a dictionary with `name` and `price` as keys.
-   find the **product name** which price is **{{params.price}}**, store it in `product_name` (We guarantee that there is only one corresponding product for the given price! Don't worry about duplication!)

<p>The setup code gives the following variables:</p>
<p><pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_for_user"></pl-external-grader-variables></p>

<p>Your code snippet should define the following variables:</p>
<pl-external-grader-variables params-name="names_from_user"></pl-external-grader-variables>
