# Finding the Type of a Variable

In a different universe, there is no built-in function to find the type of a variable. Scientists have been working on this problem for centuries. Today, you finally find the breakthrough to solve this problem - what will happen if you call a function with a variable which type is not accepted by the function?

Your job is to define a function `find_type` and it takes one argument that can either be a string or an integer. Your function should return the type of the variable. Here are some notes for the task:
- if the variable is an `int`, return "**int**"
- if the variable is a `str`, return "**str**"
- You cannot use `type()` or `isinstance()` to find the type of the variable
- You may find `len()` useful to solve the problem. Can you find any other function that can solve the problem?
